* Speech recognition : also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data. 
Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions. 
What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring words together,
with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.


* Part of speech tagging : also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech 
of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context. Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a 
verb in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’
